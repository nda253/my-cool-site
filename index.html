    <p> Georges Franju’s Les Yeux sans visage (1960) follows the story of esteemed surgeon, Dr. Génessier, living on the outskirts of Paris. With the help of his faithful assistant Edna, he seeks to recreate the face of his daughter Christiane by abducting, murdering, and transferring the faces of young French women onto Christiane. Christiane, who has been presumed dead in the car accident that permanently scarred her, spends her days hidden in her family’s estate, wearing a mask to hide her hideous face, as she slowly realizes that her father will never be able to permanently give her a face. Eventually, Christiane comes to terms with the misery of her existence and frees the latest young woman her father has abducted, and the hunting dogs being kept in the basement, who then proceed to tear Dr. Génessier to shreds. With that, Christiane disappears into the night.</p>
