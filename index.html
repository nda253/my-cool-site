    <h1><i>Eyes Without a Face</i> (1960)</h1>

    <p>Georges Franju’s <i>Les Yeux sans visage</i> (1960) follows the story of esteemed surgeon, Dr. Génessier, living on the outskirts of Paris. With the help of his faithful assistant Edna, he seeks to recreate the face of his daughter Christiane by abducting, murdering, and transferring the faces of young French women onto Christiane. Christiane, who has been presumed dead in the car accident that permanently scarred her, spends her days hidden in her family’s estate, wearing a mask to hide her hideous face, as she slowly realizes that her father will never be able to permanently give her a face. Eventually, Christiane comes to terms with the misery of her existence and frees the latest young woman her father has abducted, and the hunting dogs being kept in the basement, who then proceed to tear Dr. Génessier to shreds. With that, Christiane disappears into the night.</p>
     <p>This review comes off what is only my second viewing of Franju’s Eyes Without a Face, but this watch only supplemented and reinforced my original thoughts on the film. I appreciate Eyes Without a Face as both a horror, but also as a tragedy, which is expounded upon by film studies professor Adam Lowenstein in his book, Shocking Representation, in which he explores how the film grapples with traumatic histories. I myself, as a history major, am always fascinated by works that seek to explain or represent horrific events or histories that are otherwise unapproachable- one that comes to mind most immediately, especially in relation to the Holocaust, is Art Spiegelman’s comic Maus. Of course, Eyes Without a Face is an allegorical text, whereas Maus is a pseudo-biography, making it a much different beast to tackle.</p>
